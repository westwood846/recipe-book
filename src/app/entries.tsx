Jamming them all in!!! The weird sour sauce with vegan minced meat and some chewy mushrooms like no other (because no one would do such a thing T__T). But it's sunny outside, I'm in a good mood and the food fills my tummy. I thought that's an awesome success!",

      "I started with a bag of my favorite vegan strip chicken, thinking of making a random vegan lemongrass chicken dish. It turned out pretty savory, just the way I like it, but I wasn't sure what to pair it with. In the last 7 minutes, a genius (self-descriptive 😄) idea came to mind. How about rolling it?",
      "Yep, yep! I grabbed the bánh tráng (rice paper), the quickest-cooking type of noodles, ran to the balcony for some mint, and, of course, my beloved dưa chua (carrot & radish pickles) from the fridge. Voila! I had a semi-fancy dish. yum yum!!! ",

      "I felt humbled and inadequate cooking this dish. Chả Cá Lã Vọng (La Vong fish cake) is a very popular dish from Hà Nội, Việt Nam. As someone not born in this area, I only discovered this lovely dish after I had already become a vegetarian. Technically, I never tried the authentic version of it. I have tried and watched others cook this vegan version, and it was irresistibly fabulous. I love the richness of herbs and flavors.",
      "This recipe was learned from Cameron Stauch in his book 'Vegetarian Vietnam'. I hold no credit for it but secretly enjoy the fun of recreating the meal to fit my own preferences and respect local ingredients. I hope you enjoy watching it too.",
