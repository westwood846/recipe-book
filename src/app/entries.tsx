Jamming them all in!!! The weird sour sauce with vegan minced meat and some chewy mushrooms like no other (because no one would do such a thing T__T). But it's sunny outside, I'm in a good mood and the food fills my tummy. I thought that's an awesome success!",

It turned out pretty savory, just the way I like it, but I wasn't sure what to pair it with. In the last 7 minutes, a genius (self-descriptive 😄) idea came to mind. How about rolling it?",

      "I felt humbled and inadequate cooking this dish. Chả Cá Lã Vọng (La Vong fish cake) is a very popular dish from Hà Nội, Việt Nam. As someone not born in this area, I only discovered this lovely dish after I had already become a vegetarian. Technically, I never tried the authentic version of it. I have tried and watched others cook this vegan version, and it was irresistibly fabulous. I love the richness of herbs and flavors.",

      "My boyfriend always longs for a warm, new and fresh bread. He woke up early, went to the corner bakery and asked for 'the warmest bread that you have'. That was the line he proudly crafted, after so many tries, so many confused reactions he got from the sellers and so many ok-fresh breads... just to make sure he got the freshly baked one. About a year ago, we moved to a new place, there aren't any bakery around. We obviously had no choice but to order in advance and store them in the freeze. I wasn't (still am not) a fan of bread but I thought... how hard could it be to bake bread? hmm? If successfully doing so would make my love be happy, I gotta try.",
      "Turn out it wasn't hard at all. The bread that I made here is sourdough. I found it even easier (and tastier, in my opinion) than regular bread. I've built/made/started the starter myself since September last year and it went pretty ok ever since.",
      "I hope you find an inspiration through this video. I could have write more of the recipe in the video or edit the video better or wait for the best result (this was possibly the worst looking and tasting bread I've made this year :D ). But, well, what did I say? stay truth and show up as I am.",

It might sound like a lot but they are available most of time in my kitchen. It takes little to no effort to assembly them. The hardest part was to fry tofu/tempeh (or vegan chicken). and the second hardest part was to mix the vegan fish sauces. And everything else after that falls into its places. yummy yummy!",

      "Over the years, I've learned not to overcook or even fully boil noodles for stir-fried dishes. This time, I slightly undercooked the noodles, leaving them still a bit hard. Then, I thoroughly rinsed them under running water to ensure that the starch on the outside of the noodles was washed away. By doing this, I could confidently add them to my wok and cook them with the other ingredients. This prevents the noodles from sticking together or becoming too soft while cooking. I think this is the right attempt.",
